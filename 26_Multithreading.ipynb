    "# 🧵 Multithreading in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## ❓ Can Python do multithreading?\n",
    "\n",
    "The short answer: **yes... but** it really depends on what we mean by \"multithreading\". First, let's clarify some concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📦 What Is a Process?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **process** is an instance of a running program.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you launch an application (a browser, a Python script, a text editor), the operating system creates a process for it. Each process has:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Its own memory space\n",
    "* Its own variables and data\n",
    "* Its own resources (file handles, network connections, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Processes are **isolated** from each other by the operating system. One process cannot directly access another process's memory. This isolation improves stability and security but comes with a cost: communication between processes is relatively slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "To list all running processes on your system, you can use commands like `ps` (Linux/Mac) or use `Task Manager` (Windows).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧶 What Is a Thread?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **thread** is a smaller unit of execution *inside* a process.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single process can contain:\n",
    "\n",
    "* One thread (single-threaded process)\n",
    "* Multiple threads (multi-threaded process)\n",
    "\n",
    "Threads within the same process:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Share the same memory space\n",
    "* Share variables and data\n",
    "* Can communicate very efficiently\n",
    "\n",
    "However, because they share memory, threads must be carefully coordinated to avoid race conditions and data corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "An exemple of process could be a chrome tab, and the process it runs could be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Process: Chrome tab\n",
    "├─ UI thread\n",
    "├─ JavaScript engine thread\n",
    "├─ Network thread\n",
    "├─ Rendering thread\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And other example could be a text editor:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Process: Text Editor\n",
    "├─ Main thread → UI event loop\n",
    "├─ Auto-save thread\n",
    "├─ Spell-check thread\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Applications : I/O-bound vs CPU-bound\n",
    "\n",
    "* **I/O-bound applications**: spend most of their time waiting for input/output operations (disk, network, user input). Examples: web servers, file processing, database queries.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* **CPU-bound applications**: spend most of their time performing computations. Examples: scientific calculations, image processing, data analysis.\n",
    " \n",
    "## ⚖️ Multiprocessing vs Multithreading\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔀 Multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiprocessing** means running multiple processes in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Separate memory spaces\n",
    "* Higher memory usage\n",
    "* More expensive communication\n",
    "* Strong isolation and safety\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "* CPU-bound tasks\n",
    "* Parallel computation\n",
    "* Workloads that must scale across CPU cores\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of Python doing some multiprocessing means having several independent Python interpreters running simultaneously, each in its own process.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### 🧵 Multithreading\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multithreading** means running multiple threads within the same process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Shared memory\n",
    "* Low communication overhead\n",
    "* Faster context switching\n",
    "* Higher risk of concurrency bugs\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "* I/O-bound tasks (waiting for files, network, databases)\n",
    "* Responsive applications (GUIs, servers)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of Python doing some multithreading means having several threads running inside the same Python interpreter process.\n",

    "## 💻 CPU Cores and Hardware Parallelism\n",
    "\n",
    "A **CPU core** is a physical execution unit inside a processor capable of executing instructions independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern CPUs typically contain:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multiple physical cores\n",
    "* Sometimes multiple *hardware threads* per core (e.g., Hyper-Threading)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each core can execute **one instruction stream at a time**. With multiple cores, a CPU can truly run multiple tasks simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📅 A Short History: Before and After 2005\n",
    "\n",
    "Before roughly **2005**, most consumer processors had:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A single core\n",
    "* Increasing performance achieved by higher clock speeds\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallelism was mostly an operating-system illusion created through **time slicing**: rapidly switching between tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Around 2005, physical limits (heat, power consumption) stopped clock speeds from increasing significantly. The industry shifted toward:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multi-core processors\n",
    "* Hardware-level parallelism\n",
    "\n",
    "Since then, software has increasingly needed to be written with **concurrency and parallelism in mind**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔄 Concurrency vs Parallelism\n",
    "\n",
    "These terms are often confused but are not the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Concurrency**: multiple tasks *making progress* during the same time period\n",
    "* **Parallelism**: multiple tasks executing *at the same time* on different cores\n",
    "\n",
    "A single-core CPU can support concurrency.\n",
    "A multi-core CPU enables true parallelism.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔒 The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤔 What Is the GIL?\n",
    "\n",
    "When Python was created in the late 1980s, CPU architectures were mostly single-core. To simplify memory management and ensure thread safety, the creators of Python introduced the **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)** in 1992.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GIL prevents multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes at once. This means that even if you have multiple threads, only one can run Python code at any given moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, this seems to appear as a major limitation of the language, especially when compared to other programming languages that support multithreading more natively (C++, Rust, Java, etc.) and the GIL has been a topic of much debate in the Python community.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as Larry Hastings, a core Python developer, explained, the GIL is probably one of the reasons why Python has become so popular.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)** is a mutex (mutual exclusion lock) and exists only in **CPython**, the reference implementation of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "It enforces a rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Only **one thread** may execute Python bytecode at a time *per process*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that even on a multi-core machine, Python threads cannot execute Python code in parallel within the same process.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='files/gil.png' alt='GIL diagram' width='600'>\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❓ Why Does the GIL Exist?\n",
    "\n",
    "The GIL simplifies:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Memory management\n",
    "* Garbage collection\n",
    "* Thread safety of Python objects\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, many single-threaded Python programs are **faster and simpler** than they would be without the GIL.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ What the GIL Does *Not* Prevent\n",
    "\n",
    "* Threads can still run concurrently\n",
    "* Threads can release the GIL during blocking I/O\n",
    "* Native extensions written in C can release the GIL\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why multithreading in Python is still very useful for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* I/O-bound workloads\n",
    "* Network servers\n",
    "* Waiting-heavy tasks\n",
    "\n",
