    "## 📖 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter is the second part of the multithreading chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you know what is the GIL and how to use threads, let's talk about the ways Python is able to run code in parallel.\n",

    "## 📦 The Multiprocessing Module\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's `multiprocessing` module allows you to create multiple processes, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space. This is particularly useful for CPU-bound tasks that can benefit from parallel execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Concurrent.futures\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the `concurrent.futures` module, which provides a high-level interface for asynchronously executing callables ?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last chapter, we used `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` to run tasks concurrently using threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can use `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` to run tasks concurrently using processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax is very similar to what we used with threads, so you can easily switch between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take the same code we used in the last chapter and modify it to use `ProcessPoolExecutor` instead of `ThreadPoolExecutor`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also this time, we will use a the function `os.getpid()` to print the process ID of each task, so we can see which process is running which task."

PySpark is particularly useful for big data applications. When using on a single machine, it can still utilize multiple CPU cores for parallel processing, but it may have more overhead compared to other libraries like Dask or Polars for smaller datasets. So, unless your plan is to scale to a cluster later, prefer Dask or Polars for single-machine parallelism.\n",
