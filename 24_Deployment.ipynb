    "## 🚀 Deployment: Sharing Your Python Code With the World 🌍🐍\n",
    "\n",
    "You wrote some great Python code — nice! Now comes the important part: **deployment**. Deployment is how you package and deliver your code so other people (or systems) can actually use it. The right approach depends on *who* will use it and *how* they’ll interact with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the most common and practical ways to deploy Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🖥️ Command-Line Interfaces (CLI)\n",
    "\n",
    "Use libraries like `argparse` (built-in) or `Click` to turn your code into a command-line tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Easy to build and maintain\n",
    "* Great for automation and scripting\n",
    "* Familiar to developers and power users\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Not user-friendly for non-technical users\n",
    "* Requires Python (and dependencies) to be installed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best for:** developer tools, internal utilities, automation scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "Example with a multi argument command-line tool:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import argparse\n",
    "def main(arg1, arg2):\n",
    "    print(f\"Argument 1: {arg1}, Argument 2: {arg2}\")\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=\"A simple CLI tool\")\n",
    "    parser.add_argument(\"arg1\", type=str, help=\"First argument\")\n",
    "    parser.add_argument(\"arg2\", type=str, help=\"Second argument\")\n",
    "    args = parser.parse_args()\n",
    "    main(args.arg1, args.arg2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "And then you can run it from the command line like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python my_tool.py value1 value2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🪟 Desktop Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Use GUI frameworks like `Tkinter` and/or `PyQt` to build graphical apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**\n",
    "\n",
    "* User-friendly, visual interface\n",
    "* No command line needed\n",
    "* Can be packaged as a standalone executable\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**\n",
    "\n",
    "* More complex to develop and maintain\n",
    "* Platform-specific issues (Windows / macOS / Linux)\n",
    "* The size of the final app can be large\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best for:** tools aimed at non-technical users\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"files/pyqt.png\" alt=\"PyQt\" width=\"600\" source=\"build-system.fman.io\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌐 Web Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Use frameworks like `streamlit`, `Gradio`, `Flask`, or `Django` to create apps accessed via a browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**\n",
    "\n",
    "* No installation needed for users\n",
    "* Accessible from anywhere\n",
    "* Easy to update centrally\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Requires hosting and server management\n",
    "* Needs knowledge of web development\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best for:** dashboards, tools with many users, public-facing apps\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"files/streamlit-nyc-app.png\" alt=\"Streamlit NYC App\" width=\"600\" source=\"docs.snowflake.com\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔌 APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)\n",
    "\n",
    "Expose your functionality programmatically using `FastAPI`, `Flask-RESTful`, or `Django REST Framework`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Language-agnostic access\n",
    "* Easy to integrate with other systems\n",
    "* Scales well\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Not directly usable by non-developers\n",
    "* Requires API design and documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best for:** microservices, ML models, backend systems\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"files/fast-api.png\" alt=\"FastAPI\" width=\"600\" source=\"fastapi.tiangolo.com\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## ☁️ Cloud & Serverless Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "Deploy to platforms like **AWS Lambda**, **Google Cloud Functions**, or **Azure Functions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**\n",
    "\n",
    "* No server management\n",
    "* Scales automatically\n",
    "* Pay only for what you use\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cold start latency\n",
    "* Execution time and resource limits\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best for:** event-driven tasks, lightweight APIs, background jobs\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"files/aws-lambda-function.jpg\" alt=\"AWS Lambda\" width=\"600\" source=\"vticloud.io\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧰 Package Distribution (PyPI)\n",
    "\n",
    "Package your code with `setuptools` or `poetry` and publish it to PyPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Easy installation via `pip`\n",
    "* Encourages reuse and versioning\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"files/PyPI_logo.svg\" alt=\"PyPI\" width=\"600\" source=\"pypi.org\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📦 Containerization (Docker)\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Docker to bundle your code, dependencies, and runtime into a container. (You can also use `podman` if you're using a Linux system.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Works the same everywhere\n",
    "* Easy to deploy and scale\n",
