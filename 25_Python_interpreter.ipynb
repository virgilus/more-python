    "# 🐍 Python Interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 How does Python work under the hood?\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing how Python works under the hood can help you understand its performance characteristics, debugging, and even how to write better code, especially if you come from other programming languages or if you want to write multithreaded or high-performance applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💻 How any program runs on your computer ?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are basically two components that are relevant: your processor (the CPU, like Intel or ARM or AMD) and your memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📜 How Source Code Is Executed: From Text to Machine Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write source code—whether in Python, Java, C, or C++—you are simply creating a **text file** stored on your hard disk. This text file is perfectly understandable\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the **processor cannot understand source code directly**. A CPU only understands **machine code**, which consists of low-level binary instructions (ones and zeros). For this reason, source code must be translated before it can be executed. That what the compiler does : translating a source code into machine code for a specific platform (processor and operating system).\n",
    "\n",
    "And the output is always going to be a binary file that contains the machine code instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ Compiled Languages: The Traditional Approach (ahead of time compilation)\n",
    "\n",
    "In compiled languages such as **C, C++, or Go**, this translation is done by a **compiler**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A compiler is a program that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* takes **source code** as input,\n",
    "* translates it into **machine code** for a specific processor and operating system,\n",
    "* and produces a **binary executable** as output.\n",
    "\n",
    "This binary file contains instructions encoded in ones and zeros that the processor can execute directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you double-click such a binary, the operating system:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. loads the binary into memory,\n",
    "2. instructs the processor to start executing its instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the standard execution flow for compiled languages.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🐍 Python: A Different Execution Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Python works differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 The Python interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a simple file called `hello.py` containing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Hello, world\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this program, you type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python hello.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the key point:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **You are not running your Python source code directly. You are running the Python interpreter.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `python` command launches the **Python interpreter**, which is itself a **compiled binary program**. The machine code loaded into memory belongs to the interpreter—not to your `hello.py` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 Pyton Compiler and Python Virtual Machine (PVM)\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, the Python interpreter consists of two major components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The compiler**\n",
    "2. **The Python Virtual Machine (PVM)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how they work together.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📝 Step 1: Compilation to Bytecode\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python3 hello.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "the filename `hello.py` is passed as an argument to the interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **compiler component** of the interpreter:\n",
    "\n",
    "* reads your Python source code,\n",
    "* translates it into an **intermediate representation** called **bytecode**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This bytecode is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a binary format (ones and zeros),\n",
    "* **not machine code**,\n",
    "* **not specific to any processor**,\n",
    "* designed to be executed by the Python Virtual Machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ▶️ Step 2: Execution by the Python Virtual Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Python Virtual Machine (PVM)** is the component that understands Python bytecode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its role is similar to that of a physical CPU:\n",
    "\n",
    "* it reads bytecode instructions,\n",
    "* interprets them,\n",
    "* and executes their behavior using the underlying hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "The processor itself never executes Python bytecode directly. Instead, it executes the machine instructions of the Python interpreter, which in turn interprets and executes the bytecode.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why Python is often described as an **interpreted language**, even though compilation does occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"files/python_interpreter_cpu_memory.png\" alt=\"Python Interpreter Execution Flow\" style=\"max-width: 600px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔬 Inspecting the Bytecode\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠️ Compiling Without Running\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to compile a Python file without executing it, you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m py_compile hello.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command:\n",
    "\n",
    "* compiles `hello.py` into bytecode,\n",
    "* stores the result in the `__pycache__` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside that directory, you will find a file like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "hello.cpython-311.pyc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `.pyc` extension indicates a **bytecode file**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 👀 Viewing the Bytecode File\n",
    "\n",
    "If you display the contents of this file using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cat hello.cpython-311.pyc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(or `type` on Windows), you will see mostly unreadable characters. This is expected: bytecode is a **binary format**, not meant to be human-readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may notice fragments like `\"Hello, world\"` inside the file, but most of it consists of binary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📖 Disassembling Bytecode for Humans\n",
    "\n",
    "To view a **human-readable version** of the bytecode, Python provides the `dis` module (short for *disassemble*):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python3 -m dis hello.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command outputs a sequence of **bytecode instructions**, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "LOAD_CONST\n",
    "LOAD_NAME\n",
    "CALL_FUNCTION\n",
    "RETURN_VALUE\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these instructions is understood by the Python Virtual Machine and executed step by step on your hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📌 A Note on Implementations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏆 Cpython: The Reference Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a **language specification**, not a single program. What we have described here is a specific implementation called **CPython**, which is the reference and most widely used implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you download Python from **python.org**, you are installing CPython. For practical purposes, it is safe to assume that this is how Python works on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other languages, such as **Java**, follow a very similar model: source code → bytecode → virtual machine execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔀 Other Implementations\n",
    "There are other implementations of Python, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **PyPy**: An alternative implementation focused on speed, using Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Jython**: Python implemented on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **IronPython**: Python for the .NET framework."
